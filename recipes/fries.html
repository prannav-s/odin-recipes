        <h3>Air Fryer French Fries</h3>
        <h4>The Crispiest Air Fryer French Fries</h4>
        <p>The air fryer method for making homemade French fries is the easiest for cooking fries. Not only is it easy to make, but they are also much healthier than deep frying in oil.</p>
        <p>Both the prep and cooking for this recipe are so simple. Thinly sliced potatoes lightly tossed in oil and seasoning, then cooked until crispy and crunchy.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3> 
        <ul>
            <li>1 lb russet potatoes, (2 large or 3 medium potatoes)</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp salt, or to taste</li>
            <li>⅛ tsp ground black pepper, or to taste</li>
            <li>⅛ tsp garlic powder</li>
            <li>⅛ tsp paprika</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How to Make French Fries in Air Fryer

        </h3> 
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Scrub potatoes:</strong> We just wash them and keep the skins on, but you can peel if you prefer.</li>
            <li><strong>Cut potatoes:</strong> Clean the potatoes and cut into about ¼” inch strands, making sure all the strands are the same size for even cooking. Rinse the fries under cold water and pat dry.</li>
            <li><strong>Season:</strong> Add the fries into a bowl and drizzle with oil and toss, season and toss again. Evenly spread the fries into the air fryer basket.</li>
            <li><strong>Air fry:</strong> Cook the fries until crispy and golden, tossing halfway.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><em><strong>Pro Tip: </strong>Season the potatoes just before air frying them. If you add salt too early, it will draw moisture out of the potatoes and cause they won’t be as crispy when air fried.</em></p>
